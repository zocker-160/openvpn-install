## openvpn-install
OpenVPN installer for Debian, Ubuntu and CentOS.

This script will let you setup your own VPN server in no more than a minute, even if you haven't used OpenVPN before. It has been designed to be as unobtrusive and universal as possible. It supports internal networking between the devices connected to the VPN. [Original fork](https://github.com/Nyr/openvpn-install)
